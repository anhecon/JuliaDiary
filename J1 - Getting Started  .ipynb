    "# Getting Started with Julia\n",
    "* Composed by Anh Tran, PhD Candidate, Department of Economics, University of Bologna.\n",
    "* This note is adapted mainly from the book **Mastering Julia** by Malcolm Sherrington and various sources (will be cited accordingly). \n",
    "* I assume no prior experience with Julia or Python, to which Julia's scripting is close, so I start from the very beginning. I focus on those most relevant for econometrics problems and so neglect many others.\n",
    "* Sometimes I work on a working station in my office but most of the codes are performed on IJulia (or JuliaBox - a very similar kernel) on my laptops, either ASUS F555L or VAIO T13.\n",
    "* Compilers: there are many available compilers for Julia but I choose Atom (a cross-platform one) with Juno package for Julia. \n",
    "* OS: I found Julia starts a bit faster on Linux (on the VAIO) and a bit slower on Wins (on the ASUS) but the performance is almost the same. \n",

    "    * Basic statistics is provided by `Stats.jl` and `StatsBase.jl`. There is support for time series, cluster analysis, hypothesis testing, MCMC methods and more. \n",
    "* For mathematics: \n",
    "    * The core includes: random number generators & exotic functions \n",
    "    * Packages are available for elemental calculus operations, ODE solvers, Monte-Carlo methods, programming and optimization. \n",
